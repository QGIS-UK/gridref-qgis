QGIS Plugin that takes map coordinates and returns a OSGB Grid Ref e.g. SX4855 

The plugin makes use of Matt Walker's GridRef web service: https://github.com/walkermatt/gridref-web 

Only works with the EPSG:27700 projection

TODO

Make use of Message Bar instead of box
Add user defined input to retrieve different Grid refs
